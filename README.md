# Front-End Web Developer Techdegree – Project 2
 This is my second techdegree project. 

## Updates 
 **04.11.2020**
    I started the project. I focused on structuring the HTML and getting the layout to transfrom from one to three columns depending on the size of the browser window. There is no styling other than the font and the backgrounds colours (which are temporary — they are for testing the responsiveness only).
